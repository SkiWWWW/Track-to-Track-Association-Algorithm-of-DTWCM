# Track-to-Track-Association-Algorithm-of-DTWCM
The Python implementation of the DTWCM algorithm in my paper. I only uploaded 4 experimental scenarios data on GitHub, you can process your own data into the shape of my data or modify the codes in the DTWCMalgorithm.py.

The Python packages you need are:
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. pulp
4. numba
